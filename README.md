# PayLedger

A double-entry ledger and payments platform built with Java and Spring Boot: accounts, deposits and transfers with idempotency keys, a transactional outbox to Kafka, and a separate notification service.

> Work in progress. The design and build plan are being implemented in small, tested parts.

## Modules

| Module | Port | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `payments-service` | 8080 | Accounts, ledger, transfers |
| `notification-service` | 8081 | Reacts to payment events |

## Run locally

Requirements: Java 25 and Docker. Maven is not needed; the wrapper downloads it.

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
./mvnw -pl payments-service spring-boot:run
./mvnw -pl notification-service spring-boot:run
```

Check health at http://localhost:8080/actuator/health and http://localhost:8081/actuator/health.

## API

Until authentication is added, the caller is identified by the `X-Owner-Id` header.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/accounts` | Open an account in `BDT`, `EUR` or `USD` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/accounts` | List the caller's accounts, oldest first |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/accounts/{id}` | Read one of the caller's accounts |

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/v1/accounts \
  -H 'X-Owner-Id: ayesha' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"currency":"BDT"}'
```

Amounts are whole numbers in the currency's smallest unit (paisa, cents), so `balanceMinor: 50000` means 500.00.

## Test

```sh
./mvnw verify
```

Integration tests start PostgreSQL in Docker with Testcontainers.
